=== Claude Work Log ===

[2025-10-19] Analysis of Biddable App Structure
- Analyzed project structure: Next.js 14 app with TypeScript
- Reviewed core components: Navigation, Dashboard, Asset Creator, Reporting
- Reviewed dependencies: Using shadcn/ui components, react-hook-form, zod
- Current state: No authentication implemented
- Task: Provide recommendations for adding Supabase authentication

[2025-10-19] Auth Implementation Plan Created
- Requirements gathered: email/password, invite-only, multi-org access
- Created .env.local.example with Supabase config
- Planning full authentication implementation
- Updated approach: Using anon/publishable key with RLS policies (best practice)

[2025-10-19] Auth Implementation Completed
- Installed @supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr packages

- Created comprehensive policy reset: reset_all_policies.sql
  - Disables RLS temporarily
  - Drops ALL policies using dynamic SQL loop
  - Re-enables RLS
  - Creates clean, simple policies with no recursion

[2025-10-21] Convert Audience IDs from UUID to BIGINT (int8)
- Reason: Consistency with campaigns table and better UX
  - Long UUIDs in URLs are cumbersome to copy (must copy in segments)
  - BIGINT IDs (like campaigns) can be copied with one double-click
  - Power users of ad platforms expect simple numeric IDs
- Created SQL migration: convert_audience_id_to_bigint.sql
  - Drops and recreates audiences table with BIGSERIAL ID
  - Drops and recreates campaign_audiences junction table with BIGINT audience_id
  - Preserves all table structure, constraints, indexes, and RLS policies
  - Note: Existing test data will be deleted (acceptable at this stage)
- Updated all TypeScript interfaces to use number instead of string:
  - components/audience-detail-content.tsx
  - components/audiences-content.tsx
  - components/campaign-detail-content.tsx (Audience and CampaignAudience interfaces)
- Updated API routes to handle BIGINT IDs:
  - app/api/audiences/[id]/route.ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    - Added ID validation (isNaN check)
  - app/api/campaigns/[id]/audiences/route.ts (POST, DELETE)
    - Convert audience_id to Number() before database operations
- All audience URLs now use simple numeric IDs: /audiences/123
- IDs are now consistent across the platform:
  - Campaigns: BIGINT
  - Audiences: BIGINT
  - Assets: UUID (appropriate for creative files)

  - file_url: Supabase storage URL for uploaded media
- Debugging Issues Resolved:
  - Issue 1: Infinite re-render loop
    * Cause: Preview callback function recreated on every render
    * Solution: Wrapped handleRedditAdPreview with useCallback in asset-creator-content.tsx
  - Issue 2: Database constraint violation (ad_format)
    * Error: "new row for relation 'assets' violates check constraint 'assets_ad_format_check'"
    * Initial investigation thought it was ad_format field
    * Created migration to add 'reddit_promoted_post' to allowed values
  - Issue 3: Database constraint violation (type) - ROOT CAUSE
    * Error: "new row for relation 'assets' violates check constraint 'assets_type_check'"
    * Root cause: 'reddit_ad' not in allowed types
    * Solution: Updated migration to fix BOTH constraints (type and ad_format)
    * Fixed: Reddit ads now save successfully to database
