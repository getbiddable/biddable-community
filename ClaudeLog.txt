  - No subqueries needed for organization_members SELECT policy

- Created comprehensive policy reset: reset_all_policies.sql
  - Disables RLS temporarily
  - Drops ALL policies using dynamic SQL loop
  - Re-enables RLS
  - Creates clean, simple policies with no recursion
  - organization_members: just checks user_id = auth.uid()

[2025-10-21] Convert Audience IDs from UUID to BIGINT (int8)
- Reason: Consistency with campaigns table and better UX
  - Long UUIDs in URLs are cumbersome to copy (must copy in segments)
  - BIGINT IDs (like campaigns) can be copied with one double-click
  - Power users of ad platforms expect simple numeric IDs
- Created SQL migration: convert_audience_id_to_bigint.sql
  - Drops and recreates audiences table with BIGSERIAL ID
  - Drops and recreates campaign_audiences junction table with BIGINT audience_id
  - Preserves all table structure, constraints, indexes, and RLS policies
  - Note: Existing test data will be deleted (acceptable at this stage)
- Updated all TypeScript interfaces to use number instead of string:
  - components/audience-detail-content.tsx
  - components/audiences-content.tsx
  - components/campaign-detail-content.tsx (Audience and CampaignAudience interfaces)
- Updated API routes to handle BIGINT IDs:
  - app/api/audiences/[id]/route.ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    - Added ID validation (isNaN check)
  - app/api/campaigns/[id]/audiences/route.ts (POST, DELETE)
    - Convert audience_id to Number() before database operations
- All audience URLs now use simple numeric IDs: /audiences/123
- IDs are now consistent across the platform:
  - Campaigns: BIGINT
  - Audiences: BIGINT
  - Assets: UUID (appropriate for creative files)
