  - Solution: Simple policy that just checks user_id = auth.uid()
  - No subqueries needed for organization_members SELECT policy

- Created comprehensive policy reset: reset_all_policies.sql
  - Disables RLS temporarily
  - Drops ALL policies using dynamic SQL loop
  - Re-enables RLS
  - Creates clean, simple policies with no recursion
  - organization_members: just checks user_id = auth.uid()
  - organizations: uses EXISTS with subquery (safe because org_members policy is simple)
